## Features
* A challenging snake game that plays on a cube instead of a 2D plane
* computes rotated frame perspective using quaternionic algebra for quick transformations
* Uses linked lists to keep track of snake segments and fast updating of position
* The AI is implemented using an A* search algorithm and binary heap for quick path look ups
* uses Twine in conjunction with Three.js, to animate transitions
